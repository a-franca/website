I just added new features to [Rustpix](https://github.com/a-franca/rustpix):

- Keep Originals: Optional flags (-k, --keep-original) for preserving original files;
- Support for custom naming output files (Defaults to UUIDv4.webp name);
- It's possible to select output file quality (Defaults to 75% if none is provided).
