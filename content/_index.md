<h1>Hey, I'm Andre,<br />and this is my personal blog.</h1>

Here, you will see me writing about things I love and my thoughts on different topics, specially technology, of which I am a great enthusiast by the way.

In my spare time, I study programming languages.  
I want to be able to contribute, not only financially, to FOSS projects that I like, or to develop a useful application some day as a hobby project.

I don't post often. Like most of you readers, I am a very busy person with my family and work. However, quality over quantity, so I hope you understand.

Last but not least, this site provides both an [RSS](/feed.xml) feed, so you can catch up on what I'm posting using your newsreader client of choice.
