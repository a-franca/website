# Hi, I'm Andre!

Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my thoughts, interests, and passions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring programming languages. My goal is to contribute to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) projects that inspire me, or even create useful applications as fun hobby projects someday.

Like many of you, I'm juggling a busy life. So, while I don't post frequently, I believe in quality over quantity.

Last but not least, this site includes RSS feeds for both [Posts](/feed.xml) and [Notes](/notes.xml), so feel free to subscribe.
