In the "modern world", streaming services have become the dominant method of music consumption. Platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and others offer millions of tracks at the tip of our fingers, promising convenience and endless music. On the surface, this innovation appears to be a blessing for music lovers. However, the more I tried to engage with these platforms, the more I found myself disappointed with the experience they offer. My disappointment are based on several factors: the algorithm-driven playlists that strip away the joy of discovering full albums, the financial exploitation of artists, the manipulation behind chart rankings, and the loss of genuine connection with the music itself. The way music is consumed today feels impersonal and transactional, rather than an experience that truly resonates with listeners and respect the artists who create it.

One of my biggest issues with streaming music services is how they have fundamentally changed the way people engage with music. Before the rise of these platforms, discovering music was a personal, intentional act. You would borrow from a friend or purchase an album, sit down, and listen to it from beginning to end, immersing yourself in the story the artist intended to tell. Albums were cohesive works of art, almost always curated to provide a narrative or emotional journey. I felt like each song had its place and meaning within the larger context of the album. The physicality of buying a record or a CD also added to the experience like admiring the album artwork.

Streaming services, however, have prioritized playlists and algorithmic recommendations over albums. The music is no longer consumed as a whole, but instead, it is fragmented into bite-sized pieces. Algorithms that, like in social media, are designed to keep listeners on the platform for as long as possible, often favoring catchy, easily digestible tracks over more profound, experimental, or complex works. This shift means that listeners are far less likely to experience albums in their entirety. Instead, they hear the same trending songs repeatedly. The algorithm dictates what is "recommended," pushing music that fits a particular mold rather than encouraging the listener to explore outside of people's comfort zone.

The convenience of curated playlists has also led to a passive listening culture - the same works on video streaming platforms. Instead of seeking out new music or diving deep into an artist’s discography, people are content to let the algorithm do the work for them. Music, in my view, should be an immersive experience, something that engages us fully, not something that fades into the background as we go about our daily routines.

Beyond the loss of artistic engagement, streaming services are notorious for their inadequate compensation of artists. The vast majority of musicians earn a pittance from streams. 
{{< url "According to reports" "https://www.indiemusicacademy.com/spotify-royalties-calculator">}}, Spotify pays artists approximately $0.003 to $0.005 per stream. This means that even moderately successful musicians struggle to make a living from their music on these platforms. For an artist to earn a sustainable income, their songs need to accumulate millions of streams, a nearly impossible feat for independent or niche artists.

This financial model favors major record labels and popular artists while leaving independent musicians to fend for themselves. The artists who do not conform to algorithmic preferences or mainstream tastes are often buried beneath the flood of content. This reality is especially disheartening when you consider how much time, effort, and personal investment goes into creating music. It is an inherently exploitative system that devalues the creative labor of musicians while enriching corporate entities. Streaming platforms present themselves as a solution for artists to reach a wider audience, but in reality, they function more like gatekeepers, deciding which artists get exposure and which remain in obscurity.

In contrast, buying albums directly from artists or through platforms like Bandcamp allows musicians to retain a larger share of the profits. This direct support empowers artists to continue creating without being at the mercy of corporate algorithms. When I purchase a physical album or a digital download, I know that a significant portion of my money is going straight to the person who created the music. This transaction feels fairer and more meaningful than handing a subscription fee to a tech conglomerate.

Another troubling aspect of streaming services is the manipulation behind their “top” charts. On the surface, these charts appear to reflect public taste and organic popularity. In reality, they are again heavily influenced by record labels and corporate interests. Major labels often have partnerships with streaming platforms, allowing them to push their artists to the forefront through prominent playlist placements and advertising. This practice creates the illusion that certain artists are more popular than they actually are.

Moreover, there have been {{< url "numerous reports of fraudulent streaming practices" "https://news.sky.com/story/fraud-gangs-stealing-billions-from-music-industry-via-fake-streams-13163016">}}. Some labels and management companies artificially inflate streaming numbers through bots or other deceptive methods. As a listener, I find it demoraling to know that the music being promoted is not always a reflection of genuine public enthusiasm but rather the result of corporate agendas. There is something fundamentally dishonest about the way music is marketed through streaming services, and it weakens the integrity of the industry as a whole.

I still find much greater satisfaction in buying albums directly from artists. Owning an album provides a sense of permanence and value that streaming simply cannot replicate. There is something deeply rewarding about listening to it with full attention. Even digital downloads feel more substantial than streaming because they represent an actual exchange of value between the artist and me.

In an era dominated by convenience and instant gratification, it can be challenging to resist the allure of streaming services. By choosing to buy albums and prioritize deep listening, we can reclaim a more intentional and meaningful relationship with music. Supporting artists directly is not only a financial decision but also a moral and cultural one to me. It allows musicians to retain control over their work and fosters a more diverse musical landscape. Furthermore, it encourages listeners to slow down and fully engage with the art they consume, rather than passively allowing algorithms to dictate their tastes.
