Using {{< url "Sveltia-CMS" "https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms">}} on my blog has been an interesting experience. Long ago, when I first started exploring content management systems, I switched to Ghost [and posted about it]({{< relref "/posts/2022/ghost-as-my-blogging-platform/index.md" >}}). For multiple reasons, [which I had explained in another post]({{< relref "/posts/2023/website-4-dot-0/index.md" >}}), I ditched Ghost, and by that time, I went back to Jekyll - currently I build this site with {{< url "Hugo" "https://gohugo.io/">}}. One drawback of working with a Static Site Generator is usually the need of dealing with content, coding, building, git, and so on, and this can be time-consuming. [I mentioned in a recent post]({{< relref "/posts/2025/between-two-languages/index.md" >}}) that "my primary goal here has always been to write more, not to get bogged down..." with anything else, but content. My target was to find a solution that didn’t add unnecessary complexity to my workflow while allowing me to maintain control over my content. Sveltia-CMS has largely delivered on that front, and using it has improved the way I handle my blog. There have been plenty of positives, especially on how it integrates seamlessly with GitHub, and how it simplifies my publishing workflow. But, like any tool, it’s not without its limitations—particularly when it comes to mobile usability.

One of the most immediate benefits I’ve noticed using Sveltia-CMS is how much it has streamlined the process of publishing content. Before giving it a go, my workflow involved using a text editor, managing content through Git, and pushing updates manually. That always felt cumbersome, especially when I wanted to make quick edits or push out a simple post or note. Each time, I’d need to open my text editor, ensure that markdown was correctly formatted, commit the changes, and push them to my repository. This workflow, while manageable, often felt like overkill for smaller updates. Sveltia-CMS changed that by offering a more straightforward way to interact with my content. Now, I can manage posts directly through a clean interface without needing to dive into my editor or navigate Git’s command-line interface. It saves time and reduces friction, which ultimately encourages me to post more frequently.

Another thing I appreciate about Sveltia-CMS is how well it integrates with GitHub. Since the source code is hosted there, maintaining that connection is essential. Sveltia-CMS acts as a bridge, allowing me to make updates without leaving the CMS interface, and it automatically syncs everything to my repository. This integration means I don’t have to worry about manual commits or forgetting to push changes, which used to happen occasionally. The automated process is both reliable and transparent—every change is still version-controlled, which gives me peace of mind. I know that if I ever need to roll back a post or revisit older content, the full history is safely stored in my GitHub repository.

However, it’s not all perfect, and there are areas where I feel Sveltia-CMS could improve, particularly when it comes to mobile usability. While the interface works smoothly on desktop, using it on my phone is a different story. I often find myself wanting to make quick edits or post updates while away from my main computer, but the experience on mobile devices is shit. Navigation feel clunky, and most UI elements don’t respond as smoothly as I’d like. The interface doesn’t scale properly to a smaller screen, making it harder to interact with controls even rotating the screen. It’s a minor annoyance when I’m at home, but when I’m on the go, it becomes a real limitation.

Given how much of my life happens on mobile devices, this feels like an area for improvement. I’d love to see better responsiveness and a more polished mobile experience, especially since the rest of the CMS feels simple, but well thought out. There are times when I have an idea or spot a mistake while browsing my blog on my phone, and I wish I could fix it right there.

Despite these mobile frustrations, Sveltia-CMS positives far outweigh the negatives. It has made my blogging workflow significantly easier. The combination of GitHub integration and a clean interface makes for a powerful CMS. I no longer feel tied to a technical process when I want to share something new. Instead, I can focus on writing and trust that the CMS will handle the rest.

Looking ahead, I’m hopeful that Sveltia-CMS will continue to evolve. If the developers focus on improving mobile usability while maintaining the existing strengths, it could become an even more indispensable tool. In many ways, using Sveltia-CMS has reconnected me with why I started blogging in the first place. At end of the day, blogging is about sharing ideas and connecting with with people.
