This is my first movie review, and it comes with lots of controversies.

This weekend, with a mix of nostalgia, me, my wife and our kid decided to watch the latest adaptation of *Snow White*. As someone who grew up surrounded by Disney classics, I was curious to revisit the timeless tale of the princess and the seven dwarfs. However, what unfolded on the screen was not the story I remembered. Instead, it was a misguided attempt to modernize (again) a beloved fairy tale, so drenched in political correctness that it lost the magic and charm that once defined it.

Even before the film's release, controversies swirled around Disney’s decisions. One of the most discussed choices was the casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White. While Zegler seemed talented, the decision to cast someone for a character explicitly described by the Brothers Grimm as having skin "white as snow" raised eyebrows. This change, though well-intentioned - given the benefit of doubt -, felt like an arbitrary attempt to check a diversity box rather than a thoughtful casting decision rooted in the story’s lore. While representation is important, it should not come at the expense of the narrative’s integrity.

The controversy did not stop at the casting. Disney also chose to eliminate the seven dwarfs, replacing them with a diverse group of weird magical companions. This decision was made to avoid perpetuating stereotypes about people with dwarfism. While sensitivity toward marginalized communities is commendable when it makes sense, erasing iconic characters undermines the source material and alienates fans who cherished the unique personalities of Doc, Grumpy, and their companions. By attempting to sanitize the story, the film lost one of its most essential elements.

Moreover, the character of Snow White herself underwent a drastic transformation. Gone is the gentle, kind-hearted princess who found joy in caring for others. In her place, we meet a headstrong, independent leader who is more interested in ruling the kingdom than finding love. While strong female characters are great and welcome not only in modern cinema but in our society, this reimagining strips Snow White of the qualities that made her beloved. Also, the original Snow White’s kindness and innocence were not signs of weakness, but strength. This new version, however, seems to reject any notion of vulnerability in favor of a one-dimensional display of empowerment.

Critics I've read across the web have also echoed these concerns. In a piece from *The Rolling Stone*, the writer noted how Disney’s attempt to reshape the narrative into a modern feminist allegory feels "forced and uninspired.", while The *New York Post* similarly criticized the film for "sacrificing storytelling on the altar of political correctness," highlighting how these changes dilute the emotional depth of the original fairy tale.

One of the most outrageous changes is the film’s treatment of the classic romance. The original tale revolves around the prince awakening Snow White from an enchanted sleep with true love’s kiss — a motif that has become synonymous with fairy tales themselves. In this new adaptation, the romantic subplot is downplayed to the point of irrelevance. Snow White no longer seeks or needs romantic love, a decision that feels less like a fresh perspective and more like an overcorrection. Fairy tales are, at their heart, stories of love, wonder, and transformation. By stripping away these elements, Disney delivers a film devoid of emotional resonance.

Another issue lies in the Evil Queen, arguably one of Disney’s most iconic villains, who also suffers under this new vision. Portrayed by Gal Gadot, the character loses much of her terrifying allure. In the original, the Queen’s obsessive vanity and descent into madness made her a compelling antagonist. In this version, she is reduced to a caricature of a power-hungry ruler, lacking the psychological depth that made her so frightening. Instead of evoking fear, this new Queen feels like a watered-down imitation, further undercutting the story’s dramatic stakes.

As I left the theater, I couldn’t help but reflect on how drastically Disney has deviated from the core of its storytelling legacy. Classic fairy tales have endured for centuries because they speak to universal truths: love conquers all, kindness is a strength, and good ultimately triumphs over evil. These stories resonate because of their timelessness. In its effort to cater to modern sensibilities, Disney has sacrificed the heart and soul of *Snow White*.

Perhaps, the most frustrating aspect is the missed opportunity for a nuanced modernization. I think that updating fairy tales for contemporary audiences is not inherently a bad thing. For example, 2015’s *Cinderella*, directed by Kenneth Branagh, managed to introduce its heroine with intelligence while preserving the core themes of kindness and forgiveness. Similarly, 2017’s *Beauty and the Beast* expanded Belle’s character without stripping away the enchantment of the original. This *Snow White*, however, fails to strike that balance. It replaces timeless magic with a checklist of modern tropes, leaving behind a hollow shell of what could have been a beautiful retelling.

Beyond the narrative missteps, there is also a larger cultural conversation at play. Disney’s commitment to political correctness seems to stem from a fear of backlash rather than a genuine desire to tell richer, more inclusive stories. This defensive posture resulted in a film that felt sanitized and, ironically, less inclusive because it failed to capture the full spectrum of human experience. True inclusivity does not require erasing the past; it requires embracing and expanding upon it in thoughtful, creative ways.

Audiences seem to agree. Early reviews and audience reactions have been overwhelmingly negative, with many considering the film as "soulless" and "unnecessary." On YouTube, the trailer for the film faced an avalanche of dislikes, reflecting a growing discontent among viewers who feel alienated by Disney’s heavy-handed approach. Even casual fans have expressed frustration on social media, lamenting the loss of the magic they once associated with Disney fairy tales.

What is particularly disappointing is that the core of *Snow White* is a deeply human story. At its heart, it is a tale about envy, innocence, and the transformative power of love. The 1937 film captured these themes with elegance and heart. In contrast, this new adaptation feels like a lecture rather than a story, prioritizing messaging over genuine emotion.

By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering: Who is this movie for? It fails to satisfy fans of the original while offering little to engage new audiences. Children, the primary demographic for Disney films, are unlikely to connect with the joyless tone and lifeless characters. Meanwhile, adults who cherished the original are left with a bitter reminder of how corporate agendas can drain the soul from beloved stories.

In conclusion, the new *Snow White* is a cautionary tale in its own right. It exemplifies the dangers of prioritizing political correctness over storytelling. While there is merit in striving for inclusivity and modern relevance, these goals should never come at the expense of narrative integrity and emotional authenticity. I would say that fairy tales endure because they speak to something fundamental about the human condition. When we strip them of their magic, we lose more than just a story, we lose a piece of our cultural imagination. Sadly, Disney’s *Snow White* is a pale imitation of the classic, a reminder that not all reimaginings are worth the price of admission.
