Since I created this blog, I have primarily written in English because of the broader reach it provides. English opens the door to a global audience, allowing my ideas to be shared and discovered by people from different countries and backgrounds. Also, the internet is dominated by English content, and writing in this language has always seemed like the most effective way to connect with a larger readership. Yet, despite the advantages, I often find myself wondering if I should write more in Portuguese. It is my native language, after all, and there is something deeply personal and authentic about expressing myself in the language I grew up speaking.

The decision to write in English came naturally at first. I wanted my blog to reach as many people as possible. The truth is that if I had started writing solely in Portuguese, my audience would have been far more limited. Few Brazilians read content in English, let alone in Portuguese actually, and I knew that choosing to write in a globally dominant language would increase my visibility. I've had readers from countries I never imagined reaching, and the feedback I receive often reaffirms my choice. But lately, I cannot shake the feeling that by focusing exclusively on English, I'm neglecting a part of myself and a part of Brazilians who share my language or some of my cultural experiences.

There is sort of a unique intimacy in writing in your native language that is hard to replicate in a second language. While I'm quite comfortable expressing myself in English (even tough I still make some mistakes), there are nuances and emotional layers that only Portuguese seems to capture. Certain phrases and cultural references lose their richness when translated. I often find myself holding back or simplifying my ideas to ensure they are accessible to non-native speakers. This compromise feels like a subtle erasure of my voice, as though I'm filtering my thoughts through a linguistic lens that does not fully reflect who I am.

I also think about the potential readers I'm leaving behind. Most people in Brazil do not speak basic English, and by choosing to write in a foreign language, I'm excluding them from the conversation. This feels especially ironic given that the experiences and reflections I share are often rooted in my identity as a Brazilian. Why am I addressing a global audience while ignoring the people who might relate to things I'd like to say the most? There is a certain sadness in realizing that some of the people closest to me like friends, family members, or fellow Brazilians cannot engage with my writing because of a language barrier I have imposed.

Yet, there are practical challenges to writing in both languages. Implementing i18n (internationalization) on my blog is an obvious solution, but it is not one I'm willing to pursue. The technical side of maintaining a bilingual site is, although technically easy, time-consuming and, frankly, not where I want to direct my energy. My primary goal has always been to write more, not to get bogged down in the mechanics of website configuration. Every minute spent tweaking code or troubleshooting translations is a minute not spent writing somenthing or with my family. For someone already balancing limited time, this added complexity feels more like a burden, if you know what I'm saying.

At the same time, writing in both languages without a formal i18n setup feels messy and disorganized. I think readers find it confusing to navigate a site where some posts are in English and others in Portuguese. Consistency matters to me, not just in the quality of my writing, but the user experience. And yet, I keep circling back to the question: Is the trade-off worth it if it means I can better connect with thougts or my Portuguese-speaking audience?

Another factor I cannot ignore is the nature of online visibility. English content has a higher chance of being discovered, specially through social sharing. Writing exclusively in Portuguese might create a more inclusive space for Brazilian readers, but it risks shrinking my audience significantly. And while I don't write solely for external validation, Imagining that my posts are being read and appreciated gives me the motivation to keep this site going.

Despite these concerns, there are moments when I feel like a "pull" to write in Portuguese. There is an ease and freedom that comes from writing in the language where my thoughts usually first take shape. I can be more playful with my words, more precise in my meanings, and more vulnerable in my reflections. It feels like coming home.

For me, the solution lies somewhere in the middle. Without overcomplicating my workflow, I will dedicate specific posts/notes to each language depending on the topic, complexity of what I'd like to express, or when the mood strikes - similar to what people already see in this site, but more often. I don't want to overthink it or make it a rigid policy. Some reflections certainly resonate more with a Brazilian readership, while others are better suited for a global audience. This approach allows me to engage with everyone without fully committing to the technical aspect of a bilingual site.

Ultimately, my dilemma is about more than language. I write to express myself, and I try to be authentic as much as I can. At the end of the day, my goal is simple: to keep writing. Whether in English or Portuguese, what matters most is that I continue to share my thoughts in the most meaningful way I can. Language is just the vehicle.
