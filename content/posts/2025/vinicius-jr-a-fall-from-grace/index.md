Vinícius Júnior, recently declared as one of Brazil's most promising soccer talents and elected FIFA's Best Player of the season, has become a figure of disappointment for many fans, including myself - [who have always been a fan of his playing style]({{< relref "/posts/2022/vini-jr-real-madrid.md" >}}). His journey from a celebrated athlete to a controversial figure has been marked by a series of incidents that have been tarnishing his reputation and leaving not only supporters but many people questioning his character and choices.

The controversies surrounding Vinícius began to gain significant attention after the abuses and offenses considered racist that he has been through on several occasions. For example, during a match against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium, Vinícius was subjected to persistent insults from the crowd, leading to a temporary halt in the game as officials addressed the situation.

Although these incidents elicited widespread condemnation, Vinícius's responses often escalated tensions rather than diffusing them. His confrontational demeanor towards opposing players, referees, and even fans became increasingly evident. In a Champions League match against Atlético Madrid, Vinícius was investigated for alleged misconduct, including provocative gestures towards spectators, which contributed to a hostile atmosphere and led to objects being thrown from the stands.

Such behavior not only undermines the spirit of sportsmanship but also compromises the broader fight against discrimination in the sport. Instead of channeling his frustrations into constructive dialogue or using his platform to advocate for meaningful change, Vinícius often takes actions that exacerbate conflicts, casting a shadow over his professional conduct. I dare say that the decline in the quality of his soccer, especially in Brazil's national team, is largely related to his shared, not total, focus on soccer.

More serious than his behavior on the field, off the field Vinícius chose to endorse an individual linked to criminal activities. He shared content from the pseudo-artist known as Oruam. This individual, whose real name is Maurício, is the son of Marcinho VP, a notorious leader of one of Brazil's most dangerous criminal group. Unlike Pablo Escobar's son, who dedicated his life to denouncing his father's crimes and promoting peace, Oruam's work glorifies the lifestyle associated with organized crime.

Oruam's history is fraught with legal troubles, including some arrests, the most recent being related to harboring a fugitive drug trafficker. His music and public persona frequently make direct references to criminal activities, portraying them in a manner that can be interpreted as apologetic or even celebratory. By endorsing such content, Vinícius not only disappoints fans who admire him but also sends a troubling message that contradicts the values of integrity and responsibility expected from public figures, especially from a young man who came from a favela and certainly experienced the abuses and misdeeds perpetrated by the same criminal groups defended by the artist he now shares.

Vinícius Júnior had the potential to be more than just a soccer star; he could have been an advocate for positive changes to reduce inequality, for example. Instead, his actions alienate supporters and raise serious doubts about his judgment and the bad influences he chooses to support.
