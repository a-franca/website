Samsung, a global leader in the technology industry, is often recognized for its cutting-edge devices and innovative features rivaling with Apple. From their flagship smartphones to smart home appliances, the brand has built a reputation as a powerhouse in the electronics market worldwide. Yet, despite their impressive hardware capabilities, there is one area where Samsung consistently lets users (including me) down: the delivery of timely software updates and the persistent, unavoidable issue of bloatware. As someone who relies heavily on my devices to stay connected and productive, these shortcomings have become a constant source of frustration.

What makes it worse is that I switched from an iPhone to Samsung a year or so ago, believing the company's promises of better customization, cutting-edge technology, and user-centric innovation. I was excited about the freedom that Android supposedly offered — an open ecosystem where I could personalize my experience, the opposite of Apple's iOS. Samsung's marketing made it sound like I would be stepping into a world of better control and innovation, similar to whats is offered on Google Pixel devices. But the reality has fallen far short of those promises. Instead of the seamless experience I hoped for, I find myself drowning in delayed updates and an overload of pre-installed apps I neither want nor need.

Waiting for essential Android updates as a Samsung user is like being stuck in an endless loop of anticipation and disappointment. Every time Google announces a new Android version, I find myself excited about the fresh features, especially security enhancements. But that excitement fades quickly as the weeks (usually months) drag on without an update in sight. Meanwhile, iPhone users receive their updates almost immediately as soon as it's released. It is perplexing to me that a company with Samsung's resources and technological prowess cannot manage a more efficient update cycle.

The delays stem largely from Samsung's insistence on layering their proprietary One UI skin over Android. While I can appreciate some of the customization options One UI offers, it also means that every Android update requires extensive testing and tweaking before it is rolled out to users. This drawn-out process results in staggered and unpredictable updates, especially for those with mid-range or older devices. Even if you own a flagship model, like the S24 Ultra that I bought last year, you don't get software updates within a reasonable timeframe. If you have an older phone, you are even more left behind, vulnerable to security risks and unable to access the latest Android innovations. It feels as though Samsung prioritizes newer devices while the rest of us are treated as an afterthought.

The consequences of these delayed updates are more than just an inconvenience. Security vulnerabilities are one of my biggest concerns. Without regular patches, my device is at greater risk of malware and cyberattacks. In today’s world, where personal data is constantly under threat, I shouldn't have to worry that my phone is months behind on crucial security fixes. On top of that, outdated software means missing out on new features and performance enhancements that could make my phone run smoother and more efficiently. It is frustrating to know that my device is technically capable of doing more but is held back by Samsung's sluggish update process.

Beyond the issue of slow updates, Samsung's relentless push of bloatware is equally maddening. When I buy a new phone, I expect a device that I can customize to fit my needs, not one crammed with redundant and unwanted apps (Apple does the same, however I can at least remove apps that don't affect functionality). Yet every Samsung device comes preloaded with an absurd amount of bloatware. There are two web browsers (Samsung Internet and Google Chrome), two app stores (Galaxy Store and Google Play), and an entire suite of proprietary apps I never asked for. Worse still, many of these apps cannot be uninstalled. They take up precious storage space and often run in the background, draining battery life and affecting performance. It feels intrusive, as if Samsung believes they know better than I do about what I want on my phone.

What bothers me most is the lack of choice. I understand that some users might find value in Samsung's extra apps, but why not make them optional? Give me the ability to uninstall or at least disable them fully. I want to decide which apps I use, not have them forced upon me. This lack of control over my own device only amplifies my dissatisfaction with the brand.

What I crave is the option to install a clean, unmodified version of Android — a "pure Android" experience. Stock Android is sleek, fast, and efficient. Devices running stock Android receive faster updates because manufacturers do not have to spend months adapting the software. Plus, it usually offers better performance and more control. Even from a privacy standpoint, stock Android is preferable, as it limits the number of services tracking my behavior (Although it looks like no one cares about privacy nowadays).

It doesn't seem like too much to ask for a company as large as Samsung to provide these options. Additionally, being more transparent about the update process would help manage expectations. If I know when to expect the next security patch or Android version, I might feel less like I am in the dark and more like a valued customer.

At this point, I wonder if I should consider alternatives. Samsung has the means to improve the user experience dramatically if they choose to prioritize it.

Samsung's hardware is undeniably great, but hardware alone is not enough. The long waits for Android updates, combined with the frustrating presence of unremovable bloatware, make me feel as though my preferences and time do not matter. As consumers, we deserve better. Until Samsung takes these concerns seriously, I think everyone will remain disappointed.
