Here in the southern hemisphere, we're already heading towards the worst season of all: the Summer.

My family love this season, but I don't cope very well with any temperature above 20ºC/68ºF. I dare say that since we moved from the US to Brazil, a snowy winter is what I miss the most. Now, it's only during family vacations.

Speaking of vacations, from next Saturday until the end of January, it will be my little one's first school vacation, and preparations are underway for a schedule full of activities to keep him happy and, above all, occupied.

Any parent who takes care of their child knows how hard it is to keep them entertained, especially away from screens.

Our swimming pool is set up, we've bought a printer to print out activities and colouring pages, and we've already gotten a feel for the parks in the area so that we can take him there.

Now, all I ask for is some extra energy.
