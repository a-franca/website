Yesterday, when I went to the website of my email provider, Skiff (a privacy-focused productivity platform), I came across the announcement that the company had been sold to Notion.

> As we begin to shift focus to our shared efforts with Notion, we will be closing down Skiff's product suite after a 6-month sunset period.<br />
> We encourage you to export your data and migrate custom domains within the next 6 months.

By their recommendation, I followed the instructions on {{< url "how to migrate your data" "https://skiff.com/data-migration" >}} provided at the botton of the page.

I had migrated to Skiff a few months ago when I began the transition from the Apple ecosystem, where my iCloud+ plan allowed me to host my own domain.

Before I host my email with Apple, I used Zoho Mail as my provider. The company doesn't call itself privacy-focused, but it offers an incredible service with reasonable prices and its {{< url "privacy policy" "https://www.zoho.com/mail/privacy.html" >}} is very straightforward.

Because it's a well-known and well-established service, I decided to move back to Zoho as my email provider.

In other words, that's frustrating news, but let's move on.
