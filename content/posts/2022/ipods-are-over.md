I'm definitely feeling a little nostalgic with Apple's last month announcement that the days of the iPod Touch are over. 

The first iPod was announced in October 2001, and most people agree that it revolutionized the way we listen to music nowadays. By that time, there were other music players, but no manufacturer was able to bring together an easy way for us to buy music - with some decent quality -  and offer a well designed product. Obviously, some audiophile may disagree with my "decent quality" statement, but it really was for the average user that didn't want (or need) to go deeper in all technicality in this regard. 

Recently, I wrote a post on how [Technology is evolving too fast]({{< relref "/posts/2022/technology-is-evolving-too-fast" >}}) and some concerns that I have. This can be a good example of it, I mean, the iPod has been made less relevant, and all of its feature available on our phones. So no need to keep producing it.

Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior VP of Worldwide Marketing, affirmed that music has


> “always been part of our core at Apple and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry — it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared.”

I owned two versions of iPods. The first one was an iPod Nano that was gifted to me. I still remember when I was able to install iTunes and transfer a couple of songs to it. The usability was amazing and different from anything that I have used before.

By 2009, I was able to buy an iPod touch. I'm not gonna lie that what I really wanted was to buy an iPhone, but I couldn't afford it by that time. Even so, it was an incredible device, and apart from the impossibility of inserting a sim card, I managed to do almost everything that I do with my current phone.

## Final thoughts

In a time where we consume technology and products letting ourselves be carried away by a momentary excitement, it is good to remember something that I took with me for years and that brought me great times.

After all, what remains are the good memories.
