Hi there, dear reader.

Today, you may have received some old posts again on your rss feed app, and this is due to a change on this website, where I migrated from Jekyll to Ghost.

I will explain further how and why I made this change in a separated post. For now, I would like to apologize if I may have flooded your inbox and ask you to kindly mark every post before this one as read.

Apart from that, the new rss feed url is ~~https://afhub.dev/rss~~ [^1]. I've set up redirects, so you can continue getting my posts until you have some spare time to update it.

Have a wonderful day!

[^1]: UPDATE: This domain is not being used anymore. I migrated over to my new domain [https://abf.li/](/). See [https://abf.li/feed.xml](/feed.xml) for RSS.
