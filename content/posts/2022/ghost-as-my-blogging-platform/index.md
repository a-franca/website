Recently, I posted about how I successfully migrated my jekyll static blog from Github to Codeberg Pages, also explaining my attempt to use Writefreely as my blogging platform.

I really want to make writing a habit, but I've been struggling with the lack of a true editor in Jekyll, which makes it a pain to work on the build of this habit. Well, I still think that static websites are great for a number of reasons but produce a lot of content.

Here I go again, messing around with my blog... I took a deep breath, then listed three features that are indispensable to me, before getting started looking around for platforms:

* Minimally easy to manage (content, updates, integrations, etc);
* Be allowed to custom themes;
* Useful editor UI.

Among all the options in my brief research, I liked {{< url "Ghost CMS" "https://ghost.org/">}} the most. Problem is, their managed hosting is more than Iâ€™d like to pay, so I self-hosted it. As of this writing, their starter plan is $9/mo billed yearly (or $11 billed monthly).

**Pros:**

+ Editor UI is pretty clean (so you can focus on writing) and has several features, such as a markdown and html editor;
+ You can inject code (styles or scripts, for instance) into some specific page or the entire website;
+ The project seems to be well maintained, and the backup/update process is straightforward;
+ I can schedule posts.

**Cons:**

- Themes are usually bloated, however we can get around it by creating our own;
- The excess of .js botters me a bit, and there are some penalties in performance compared to only serving html and css files (I got an optimal balance between performance with some cache optimizations as well as sitting a CDN in front of my VPS).

The newsletter/membership thing does not bother me at all, since I was able to disable it completely. I'm actually glad that if I ever want to work on it, there's such a possibility.

## Considerations

Can I guarantee that I will continue using Ghost in the future? No, because I love messing around with what isn't broken.

Regardless of anything, I really liked the platform and I want to be able to keep posting more easily and often. In addition, the possibility of scheduling posts is excellent, since if I have time and manage to write more content, I can publish it in advance.
