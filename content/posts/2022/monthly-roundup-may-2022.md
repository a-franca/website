This is an update of what happened in the previous month.

## üìù Blogging 

For this month, I didn't achieve my goal of writing a post per week, and I'm good with that.
Even though I don't keep any track about how many viewers my posts are hitting, I still have to deal with my mind that keeps telling me not to post anything that will be supposedly not interesting, nor has a supposedly good amount of words. It obviously goes against my main desire which is just to write about whatever I would like to. 

Below are the posts from the previous month:

* [Technology is evolving too fast]({{< relref "/posts/2022/technology-is-evolving-too-fast.md" >}})
* [Remove metadata from photos on iphone]({{< relref "/posts/2022/remove-metadata-from-photos-on-iphone.md" >}})
* [Is there a perfect keyboard?]({{< relref "/posts/2022/is-there-a-perfect-keyboard.md" >}})

## üìñ Reading

I listed two articles that I found interesting and are, in my opinion, worth reading.
Again there's an article in Portuguese, I wouldn't list the article if I didn't like it, so if you feel like you want to read it, but don't understand Portuguese, take this as an opportunity to learn, or just look for a translator.

## üéµ Music and/or Podcasts

Today, my recommendation is the album Back to Black (2006), by Amy Winehouse. 

His second album, Back to Black, has a strong influence of Soul and R&B, in addition to great songs. It manages to be sensitive and dancing at the same time.
This is one of those discs you can't find anything to say bad about.

There's no way you can listen to the album and not be delighted, even with sad songs, like rehab.

## üòé Other

I've finished the Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (MITx 6.00.2x) course that I mentioned last month.
The course was insightful and showed lots of possibilities when working with data. Even with the high level of abstraction, due to this course be an introduction, I feel like I'm gaining more experience, and it keeps me motivated to keep learning.
