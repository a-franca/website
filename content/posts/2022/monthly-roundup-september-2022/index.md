Little happened last month (actually, the last two months).

I tried to catch up with my personal goal of 4 posts each month and managed to successfully migrate my static Jekyll site to Ghost.

Apart from that, I am concerned about Brazil's elections. My mood may change this week based on tomorrow's outcome.
